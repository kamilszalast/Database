# Database application, which parses data from file to database, used technologies: Java 8, MySQL, Maven, GIT

Project is finished.
Architecture was made up with a help from my colleague, he has more experience in Java than me.
I tried to implement Design Patterns in my project (Strategy, Factory) because I know it is a good practice.
I am aware of securing login and password, thats why it's not directly in source code, I read it from /Outside_Files/password_file.
I know it should be hide in *.yml file but I wasn't able to implement it (I will correct that in the future).

### Parsing .csv file is working
### Parsing .xml file is working
