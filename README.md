Unfortunalety, project isn't finished , I couldn't make it before deadline.
It is caused by a lack of my knowledge which I am consistantly widening and improving.
I am going to finish this project anyway, because it's challenging and I know it will teach me a lot.
The whole architecture was made up by my colleague, he has more experience in Java than me.
I tried to implement Design Patterns in my project (Strategy, Factory) because I know it is a good practice.
I am aware of securing login and password, thats why it's not directly in source code, I read it from /Outside_Files/password_file.
I know it should be hide in *.yml file but I wasn't able to implement it (I will correct that in the future).
